  		<h1 style="text-align: left;">What is AI Prompting</h1>
    	<p>AI prompting involves giving clear and purposeful input to an AI tool in order to guide its response. The quality of a prompt can shape how useful or accurate the AI's output is.</p> <p>Effective prompting allows you to guide AI tools in ways that support the writing process without replacing critical thinking or original work.</p>
  	</div>
  
  
  
  	<div>
  		<h1 style="text-align: left;">How To Write A Good Prompt</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>State Your Goal</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarize in one sentence what you want (e.g., “Translate this text into layman’s terms”).</li>
      <li>Mention why (e.g., “For middle-school readers”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Give Context</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Include or describe the source material (text, data, code).</li>
      <li>Specify audience and tone (e.g., “Explain as if to a non-technical manager”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Structure the Prompt</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Instruction: One imperative verb + task (e.g., “List,” “Compare,” “Generate”).</li>
      <li>Context/Reference: Paste or describe relevant passages or data.</li>
      <li>Requirements: Format (e.g., bullet points, JSON), length limits, style guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be Specific</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid vague words like “Explain well.” Instead, say “Explain in ≤150 words, using three headings.”</li>
      <li>Define any acronyms or specialized terms.</li>
      <li>Clarify edge cases (“If no data is available, state ‘N/A’”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Specify Output Format</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Outline formatting rules (“Use Markdown headings,” “Return a numbered list,” “Respond in JSON with keys ‘title’ and ‘summary’”).</li>
      <li>Note language/style (“Formal tone,” “Active voice,” “American English”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anticipate Pitfalls</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Narrow the scope to prevent drift (“Focus only on economic factors, not social ones”).</li>
      <li>Tie pronouns to nouns (“‘It’ refers to the software license”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Test &amp; Refine</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the prompt, compare output vs. expectations.</li>
      <li>Tweak one element at a time (e.g., adjust word count if it’s too long).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Can you help me brainstorm personal statement topics that reflect these experiences?`, response: `Absolutely! Your volunteer work and passion for health equity are powerful themes that can make your personal statement stand out. Here are a few angles you might consider:

1. A Defining Moment in the Clinic – Share a specific patient interaction or experience that deepened your understanding of health disparities and reinforced your commitment to public health.

2. The Bridge Between Experience and Aspiration – Connect the lessons you’ve learned at the clinic with your long-term goals, showing how hands-on experience has shaped your vision for a healthier, more equitable future.

3. Health Equity Through a Personal Lens – If there’s a personal story or background that informs your interest in health equity, weaving that into your narrative can add depth and authenticity.

4. Innovative Solutions to Systemic Challenges – Reflect on challenges you’ve observed in the clinic and discuss ideas or aspirations for addressing these barriers through policy, research, or community outreach.

5. The Power of Public Health in Action – Describe how volunteering has transformed your understanding of public health beyond textbooks, emphasizing real-world impact and grassroots efforts.

Would you like help refining one of these ideas into an outline?` },

Here are some topics that blend academic achievements with extracurricular experiences to showcase your unique journey:

1. The Intersection of Passion and Learning – Describe how an extracurricular activity (e.g., robotics, theater, debate) deepened your academic interests and influenced your future aspirations.

2. Overcoming Challenges in an Academic Setting – Share a moment where you faced an academic struggle and how extracurricular involvement helped you develop resilience and problem-solving skills.

3. Leadership Beyond the Classroom – Highlight a leadership role in an organization or club and how those experiences shaped your approach to teamwork, responsibility, and intellectual curiosity.

4. A Research or Creative Project That Changed You – Discuss a significant academic or extracurricular project, competition, or experiment that transformed your thinking or solidified your career ambitions.

5. Community Engagement Through Academics and Activities – Show how you connected classroom learning with service projects, mentorship programs, or advocacy work to create meaningful change.

6. Balancing Academics and Passion – Reflect on the challenges and rewards of juggling schoolwork with a time-intensive extracurricular commitment, such as music, athletics, or entrepreneurship.

7. A Defining Moment in Your Education Journey – Narrate an experience—perhaps an inspiring teacher, a breakthrough discovery, or an extracurricular challenge—that shaped your intellectual growth.

These ideas can help craft a compelling statement that illustrates your strengths, passions, and personal growth. Which one resonates most with you?` },
        { prompt: `What should I write my personal statement about?`, response: `Your personal statement is your chance to show what makes you, you. It should capture your passions, experiences, and values in a way that feels authentic and compelling. Here are a few directions you could explore:

1. A Defining Moment – Was there a turning point that shaped who you are today? Maybe a challenge you overcame, a realization that changed your perspective, or an experience that pushed you to grow.

2. A Passion that Drives You – Whether it's art, science, activism, or something entirely unique, writing about what fuels your curiosity and excitement can create a powerful narrative.

3. A Personal Journey – You could reflect on how your background, identity, or experiences—whether cultural, familial, or personal—have influenced your ambitions.

4. A Problem You Want to Solve – If there’s an issue in the world that deeply concerns you, sharing why it matters to you and how you hope to make a difference could be an inspiring angle.

Do any of these resonate with you? If you'd like, I can help refine your ideas or workshop a structure for you!` }

The outline includes useful sections, but without personal details, the ideas remain broad.
To improve the output, add one or two specific experiences or goals that connect these areas.`,

        { prompt: `Based on my outline about my clinic volunteering and health equity interest, help me write a draft of my personal statement introduction?`, response: `The first time I stepped into the community clinic, I thought I understood public health. I had read about health disparities, studied the statistics, and engaged in classroom debates about systemic inequities. But sitting across from patients who struggled to navigate the healthcare system, I realized understanding wasn’t enough. I saw the frustration of a mother unable to afford medication for her child, the quiet exhaustion of a senior citizen juggling multiple jobs while managing chronic illness. These moments transformed my academic knowledge into something urgent and personal.
        
Volunteering at the clinic gave me more than experience—it deepened my commitment to health equity. I wasn’t just assisting with paperwork; I was listening, learning, and grappling with the realities of inaccessible care. In my health sciences coursework, these same disparities took shape in discussions about policy, ethics, and solutions. The intersection of hands-on service and academic exploration solidified my purpose: to bridge the gap between knowledge and action, to advocate for communities like the one I served, and to pursue public health as both a career and a mission.
` },
        { prompt: `Write a college essay introduction based on volunteer and school experiences.`, response: `I always believed healthcare should be accessible to everyone, but it wasn’t until I volunteered at a community clinic that I truly saw the gaps in the system. Assisting patients with paperwork and helping them navigate their care, I witnessed firsthand the challenges they faced—language barriers, financial struggles, and a lack of resources. It was eye-opening to see how these obstacles impacted real people, not just statistics in a textbook.
        
My experiences in school reinforced what I saw at the clinic. In my health sciences classes, discussions on equity and policy helped me understand the broader picture of systemic disparities. Volunteering gave me the hands-on perspective, while my studies helped me analyze possible solutions. These experiences together shaped my passion for public health and strengthened my desire to work toward meaningful change.
` },
        { prompt: `Can you write my college essay intro? It’s for public health.`, response: `The waiting room was full—families, elderly patients, people who had traveled miles just to see a doctor. As I assisted with intake forms, I noticed the uncertainty in their faces, the quiet hesitation in their voices. It wasn’t just about medical care; it was about access, trust, and systemic gaps that left communities underserved.
        
My interest in public health stems from moments like these, where individual stories reveal the broader challenges in healthcare systems. In my coursework, I explored health policies and their impact, but it was through real-world experiences that I understood the urgency behind them. I want to pursue public health not just to analyze the problems, but to be part of the solutions that make care more equitable for all.

I assisted patients with paperwork, translated for those who didn’t speak English, and listened to countless stories about the challenges people faced just trying to access basic care. One woman, for example, couldn’t get her insulin due to an issue with her insurance. That moment stuck with me—it was frustrating and heartbreaking.

      summary: {
        good: `Summary:
The AI revised the paragraph to improve sentence flow, transitions, and tone while keeping the original structure and voice intact. It enhanced clarity without over-polishing or adding ideas that weren’t already present.

Strengths:
- Improved sentence rhythm and word choice without changing meaning
- Preserved the writer’s voice and intent
- Added better transitions and clarity between ideas
- Cleaned up redundancy and awkward phrases

Weaknesses:
- Slightly more formal than the original tone (minor shift)
- One or two phrases feel slightly AI-polished rather than natural student voice

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
If you want AI to clean up your writing but still sound like you, be specific about what to change (e.g., “just flow and tone”). A detailed prompt like this gives the best balance between helpful edits and keeping your original voice.
`,
        ok: `Summary:
The AI made the paragraph easier to read by simplifying phrases and smoothing out transitions. It preserved the core message but made more edits than what was asked for, which slightly shifted the tone and style.

Strengths:
- Cleaned up repetitive or clunky phrasing
- Simplified sentence structure for better readability
- Added light transitions

Weaknesses:
- Rephrased some emotional language (e.g., “that really bothered me” became “that really stuck with me”), which slightly softened the raw, personal tone.
- Tone feels a more generic and slightly less personal
- Shortened and tightened to the point of losing student voice in places

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
A vague prompt like “make it smoother” gives AI too much freedom. If you want to keep your personal voice or structure, make sure to be clearer about what you want to preserve or else the edits may feel more like a rewrite than a revision.
`,
        bad: `Summary:
AI produced a well-written and emotional paragraph, but it significantly rewrote the original. It changed sentence structure, added phrasing that wasn’t there, and shifted the tone toward being more mature and professional.

Strengths:
- Very clear and well-organized
- Strong emotional language and polish
- Flow and transitions are excellent

Weaknesses:
- A lot different from the original (more of a rewrite than a revision)
- Loses student’s real voice and phrasing
- Adds content that wasn’t in the original draft

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
If your prompt is too vague, AI might do too much. "Make it better" tells the AI to guess what you want, which often leads to losing your personal story, tone, or structure. For small changes, be more specific.`

      summary: {
        good: `Summary:
The AI fixed grammar and punctuation issues (e.g., capitalization, verb agreement, comma placement) while preserving the original structure, phrasing, and personal tone.

Strengths:
- Corrected key grammar issues (e.g., “turn into” → “turned into”; “i” → “I”; “alot” → “a lot”)
- Preserved original word choices and paragraph structure
- Did not over-edit or rewrite content

Weaknesses:
- Some awkward phrasing (e.g., “some insurance thing”) was left untouched
- Slight inconsistencies in tone remain, because stylistic edits weren’t applied

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
This is the best option when you want clean grammar without changing your voice. If your goal is to sound like you but with fewer errors, be clear and specific in your prompt like: “Fix grammar and punctuation only.”`,
        ok: `Summary:
The AI corrected grammar and spelling while making slight edits to improve flow and clarity. It made minor tone adjustments and changed a few word choices to sound more polished.

Strengths:
- Grammar and punctuation were fully corrected
- Sentence flow improved slightly in spots
- Some informal language (e.g., “insurance thing”) was improved

Weaknesses:
- Made edits beyond grammar, including slight rephrasing
- Tone became more polished than intended
- The student’s original voice was softened in some places

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
Even with a simple prompt like “fix grammar,” AI makes more changes than what you asked for. If you want to avoid unexpected edits, add limits like “don’t change sentence structure” or “keep my original phrasing.”
`,
        bad: `Summary:
The AI fixed grammar but also reworded sentences, enhanced transitions, and added emphasis for emotional impact. It significantly changed tone and structure beyond basic corrections.

Strengths:
- Strong grammar and polished output
- Enhanced clarity and readability
- Flow and transitions improved significantly

Weaknesses:
- Rewrote portions of the paragraph
- Changed tone and structure too much for a “grammar-only” task
- Removed informal or natural student phrasing

Takeaway / Advice for Students:
Short prompts like “fix the grammar” are too vague and give AI too much room to interpret. If you only want light edits, be more specific. Otherwise, you will most likely get a rewrite instead of a revision.`
